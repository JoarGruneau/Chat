# Chat
Written by Joar gruneau for a project in object oriented program construction.

Dependencies:
common-codec-1.10
Common-lang-3.5

Description:
An simple chat application that communicates over TCP, where you can run as
server or client.
Allows you to communicate in multi-conversation, send file transfers and encrypt
the communication. The way the encryption is done here is not
secure but the project specifically stated that this was how we should do it.
